# Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the famous Kaggle "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Building a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Training the model with the dataset
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Saving and loading the trained model
- Making predictions on new images

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from the [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats). It consists of 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs. (2500 each for test data and 10000 each for train data)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the validation set after Y epochs of training.
