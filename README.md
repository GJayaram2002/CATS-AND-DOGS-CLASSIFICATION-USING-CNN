# Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the famous Kaggle "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Building a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Training the model with the dataset
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Saving and loading the trained model
- Making predictions on new images

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from the [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). It consists of 25,000 labelled images of cats and dogs (12,500 images of each).
